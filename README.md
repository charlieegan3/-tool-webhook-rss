# tool-webhook-rss

This is a tool for [toolbelt](https://github.com/charlieegan3/toolbelt) which exposes a simple RSS
service for other tools to use.

This tool exposes endpoints to POST to for new RSS items, and GET to retrieve the RSS feed.

It also has a number of tasks to ensure that the RSS state is kept clean as time passes and
items are no longer needed
